System Overview: 
 A system for managing shared office, meeting, laboratory, and teaching space is to be developed. A networked display appliance is situated outside each room. The appliance indicates who has reserved the space and for what period. The appliance allows users to reserve a room and check the availability of other rooms.
 The system is a web based scheduling system but the status of each room can be checked at location. It incorporates the use of small flat panel displays to eliminate scheduling conflicts, interruptions, and encourage better space utilization.
The system can: 
	Reserve the appropriate room when needed from any location on the network 
	Display meeting information outside each room 
	Easily extend room reservation with the touch screen 
	Release a room if meeting finishes early 
	Quickly identify occupied and available rooms by a red or green light 
	Grab a room with the touch screen for an uninterrupted impromptu meeting
Web interface
 All the room displays are networked so then can be accessed via a web interface (a single URL). Every room’s schedule can then be viewed from the web interface and maintained by an administrator. A user should be able to check the availability of any room from the room display and the web interface. The web interface allows for reserving rooms along with searching tools to find available rooms at given times. All significant management of the building’s space information will be done through this interface. 

 
1.2 Purpose

	Grab a room with the touch screen for an uninterrupted impromptu meeting.
1.3 Scope
In this system the registered user confirm about their room reservation with time. They can reserve the existing room for their purpose by maintaining the system. They have to login by their account and they can also cancel their reservation but after payment they are not be able to cancel reservation. This system such a great dill for them who need the meeting room.

1.4 Vision
For reserving a room we have to going or contact here and there for getting a room. But maintaining this system we have not to go anywhere for meeting room. This system will be manage the room for appliance by online payment.

1.6 Proposed Solution
•	Reservation with touch screen
•	Identified room by using green or red light
